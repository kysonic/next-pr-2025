## Next Book Shop

Simple Next JS application created only in learning purposes like a reminder of Next.js page router.

### Ð¡onscious decisions

- No architecture - so how it is overhead.
- No real backend - only mock API. 
- MobX as state manager to check v6 and current ecosystem (Is there some API cacher like rtk query?!)
- Check Biome (something new)
